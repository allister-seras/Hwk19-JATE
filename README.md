## Useage
JATE is a note taker that is representative of code writing applications. In JATE users can type out code snippets and have their code formatted in JavaScript formatting. For example `var`,`let`, and `const` will change color to signify that a variable is being declared. Users are also able to use `//` and `*/` to comment out their notes from code. JATE can be used in the browser or via desktop and will retain any text that has been typed in both methods of use.
